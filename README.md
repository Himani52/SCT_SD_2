🎮 Gameplay Instructions
The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 🎲

🕹️ Add difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard

📱 Make a mobile-friendly version

🧩 Add hints like "very close" if within 10 numbers

📚 Learning Outcomes
✅ Basics of Java Swing GUI programming

✅ Handling events (button clicks, input validation)

✅ Using Random class for game logic

✅ Managing state (attempt count, game over)

✅ Exception handling (NumberFormatException for invalid input)

❓ FAQ
Q1: Can I play more than once?
A: Yes! Click the Restart button to play again.
